App for learning flutter

## TODOs

- [x] check how to get app's ThemeMode properly
- [x] implement reset password flow
- [x] get list of items from firebase firestore
- [x] filter out from autocomplete list all items that were already selected
- [x] add a way to include a comment/observation for each item of the list
- [x] do a visual diagram exposing the data distribution/architecture
- [ ] add a consistent first option to "add" the string that were not found
- [ ] change the way that we add observations. Use ExpansionTile instead. _(better UX)_

## bug

- [x] when I add more than one item, and I try to add more items to one of them, both changes. Fix it!
